# WeatherApp

This program was created to demonstrate my ability to understand the assignment and my level of Java knowledge.
In this project you are able to login as an predefined user. Based on latitude and longitude of the city you can add that specific city in your list.
As well as adding the city, you are allowed to delete city and get current temperature in that city.
I tried spring security for two endpoints and used token verification for all the activity throughout the application.
This project is easy to run. You can just open it with your favorite IDE, connect to your database and use postman to give infos in payload of requests.
